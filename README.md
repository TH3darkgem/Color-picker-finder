This app lets you pick the color you're hovering above with your cursor

The app has instructions inside, but in case they're not clear enough:
1. Open the app
2. Click the "Find color" button
3. Move your mouse cursor to the color you want to know the hex code of
4. Wait 3 seconds (or take 3 seconds to do step 3)
5. If you did everything correctly, your chosen color will show up on the app's bottom
6. Click "Copy to clipboard" to copy the hex code of the chosen color to clipboard
7. Enjoy!

Text me if you want to make any modifications, that could/should be uploaded to the main branch of the github

This is a short personal challenge for myself, meaning I will likely not update it any further, or make any modifications
